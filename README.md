# data_plotting_fastf1
This repository contains some files that are used for plotting F1 data using fastf1.

## Current functions
Currently, the function plot_track_map can be called from track_map_plotter.py. This function will plot a track map with colored sectors. This can be done by running the main.py file.

**Disclaimer:** the sectors might not be 100% accurate as they are calculated using the first coordinates after a sector time has been set.
